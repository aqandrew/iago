A simple othello game written using pygame and python implementing. 
The game is in Estonian (but changing the language would only mean
changing ~10 strings) and was homework for my AI class. I am currently
quite proud of the GUI. :)

All code is free to use, but if you make something interesting using
my code, notify me by email.
